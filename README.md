# A*
## What is it?
This is just a simple pathfinding example of a*. It definitely isn't the best, but it does show a bit of how it works.

## Can I play with it? 
You sure can! Just go [here](https://editor.p5js.org/intentionalDisaster99/sketches/8eMc1LoSr), and you can mess about with it, along with also adjusting the code in real time.

## Problems
Cause of course there are problems. 

### Speed
There is also the problem that it isn't overly fast. I wanted to make the spacing by the pixel, but I knew that would be very slow, so I added in a node_distance variable. Hopefully, I can eventually get this to be fast enough to quickly find a pixel perfect path.
